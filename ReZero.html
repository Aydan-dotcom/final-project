                Re: Zero is an anime currently on its third season and will soon get a fourth, and it is a story in which the main character is taken from our world and put into a fantasy world. While this idea is common, the rest of the story differs greatly from most other stories. It follows the main character, Subaru Natsuki, as he has no idea how his new world works and doesn't know what to do, as he seems just as powerless as before. Although Subaru quickly finds out that he has been gifted with an ability that allows him to save himself alongside most of the people around him, Return by Death. This ability allows him to be brought back in time any time he is killed, but only when he is killed.

                    While the ending of Re: Zero hasn't happened yet, meaning there has yet to be a final antagonist, the story is setting up for certain characters to be fought during the finale of the story. Even though most of the conflict of the story comes from the internal struggles of Natsuki Subaru and his friends, the beings that Subaru has to fight are also some of the best-designed and well-thought-out antagonists of all time, in my opinion. Each part of the story does an amazing job of putting Subaru and his friends through immense struggles, and through the story, Subaru has died countless times. I personally rate the conflicts of Re: Zero a 10/10.

                    Re: Zero has easily the best characters out of any piece of media I've seen. The main character himself is, in my opinion, the best character I've seen for so many reasons. First, he isn't strong in a normal sense, like he is able to defeat the villain. Subaru is extremely weak compared to everyone around him, and the only things allowing him to survive are his ability and intellect. Because he is able to remember all about the previous ways he has died, he is able to constantly think of new ways to win and save everyone around him. Although this ability comes at a cost, because dying never gets easier for him, he is tortured by his constant death. This is where another trait of Subaru shines: the fact that he feels so real. He doesn't seem like another characte in a show, he feels like a regular person who got shoved into another world where he is constantly in pain, and he shows it. All of this combined with amazing side characters all with great character development gives Re: Zero a 11/10 for characters.

                <h4 style="background-color:#e0829d">
                    The plot of Re: Zero is difficult to understand, as the story is ongoing, there are still lots of things we don't know about. However, previous sections of the story have beautifully set up future events, even if sometimes the events sometimes seem to come out of nowhere. I give the plot a 9/10 for how well constructed most of it is, and I expect that the end of the story will tie most of it together nicely.
