                Re Zero is an anime currently on its third season and will soon get a fourth, and it is a story in which the main character is taken from our world and put into a fantasy world in the show. While this idea is common, the rest of the story is very different from most other stories I know of. The story follows the main character, Subaru Natsuki, as he has no idea how his new world works and doesn't know what to do, as he seems just as powerless as before. Although, Subaru quickly finds out that he has been gifted with an ability that allows him to saves himself along side most of the people around him, Return by Death. This ability allows him to be brought back in time any time he is killed, but only when he is killed.

                    While the ending of Re Zero hasn't happened yet, meaning there has yet to be a final antagonist, the story is setting up for certain characters to be fought during the finale of the story. Even though most of the conflict of the story comes from the the internal struggles of Natsuki Subaru and his friends, the beings that Subaru has to fight are also some of the best designed and well thought out antagonists of all time in my opinion. Each part of the story does an amazing job of putting Subaru and his friends through different struggles, from memory loss to his body being turned into a child, and through his struggles Subaru has died countless times. I personally rate the conflicts of Re Zero a 10/10.
