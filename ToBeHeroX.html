                To Be Hero X Ranking:
            </h4>
            <h3>
                To Be Hero X is another anime which is currently only on its first season with a couple of episodes. Even though the series is still very new and has very little content, the story so far has been amazing. The world of this show has a unique feature where a person's power is based on their trust value, corresponding to the number of people that trust the person. This allows them to do superhumans things, or in some cases not do things. The story has so far been 2 phaces, the present where Nice witnesses a semi-popular hero die and is forced to take up their role without anyone noticing, and another hero, who in my opinion is much better, who at first is a normal guy who is too scared of everything around him, until he saved a kid being kidnapped, leading to his trust score skyrocketting.

                <h4 style="background-color:#8eaebb">
                    The conflict in To Be Hero X is wierd. The first phase has alright villians, although nothing very special, except for the final villian he fights in phase 1, who is very well written in my opinion. Phase 2 has a lot less supervillians like phase 1, and more average people who act as antagonists, but the conflict is still much better than the first phase. I give the conflict a 7/10.

                <h4 style="background-color:#8eaebb">
                    The characters of To Be Hero X are pretty good, but not amazing. The main character from the first phase is alright, until the final part of the phase where he becomes a much better character then before, and during phase 2 the main character is much deeper. I give the characters an 8/10.

                <h4 style="background-color:#8eaebb">
                    The plot of To Be Hero X is quite simple, but still very entertaining. The story also uses forshadowing to great effect and the pacing is perfect. Overall, an 8/10.
